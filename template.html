    Favorite Culture that I'm not Native to
</h1>
<h4>
    Thailand
</h4>
<p> I love Thailand as a culture not only because they have good food but because the people of Thailand are also super nice people. They are very welcoming to tourist's and strangers alike. One awesome thing about Thailand is that they love colorful carnivals and other things.

<p>Lasagna is a meal that inspires me because it has layers. Kind of like me, as a person I have different layers that people will see as they get to know me. Lasagna is also the ultimate homecooked meal. It's what brings people together.</p>
<h1>Creativity Question</h1>
I feel most creative when I am taking a walk in the park and thinking about a lot of different ideas I could be accomplishing like becoming an artist painting and making stuff on a computer. Walking in the park is when I am most creative.
<h1>One Topic I would Talk about the Rest of my Life</h1>
<p>I could talk about cars for the rest of my life. Cars have always been my biggest hobby. I love everything about them. When someone else is also interested in cars such as I am, then we are friends for life as far as I am comcerned. Cars are the one thing that I relate to the most. I could talk about them forever.<p>
